# Welcome to Open Source Scholarship

Hi. My name is Daniel Davis Wood and I'm a teacher of literature. I read, research, and write about literature every day.


## Basic Resources

### My Personal Index

[My personal index](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s192/sh/4cc64c94-92be-4502-9312-79fabdcc859b/1dc522c07efe5e51e4e969f851cd1f0a) via Evernote is a list of all the resources I have on-hand in my library.

### Poetry
[My poetry archive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_FDz9fGePxpMnhENHFrWjBWTGc) via Google Drive.
[Prose excerpts](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_FDz9fGePxpZzZITFVZSFBMZEU) via Google Drive.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/danieldaviswood/danieldaviswood.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/danieldaviswood/danieldaviswood.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
