# Welcome to Open Source Scholarship

Hi. My name is Daniel Davis Wood and I'm a teacher of literature. I read and write about literature pretty much every day. I think about it, I research it, I discuss it with others, and I try to share my findings and knowledge as widely as I can. On these pages, you'll find resources for students of literature and details on a few of the literary projects I'm working on right now. [Why?](rationale.md)
