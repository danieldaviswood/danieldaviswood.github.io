# Welcome to Open Source Scholarship

Hi. My name is Daniel Davis Wood and I'm a teacher of literature. I read and write about literature pretty much every day. I think about it, I research it, I discuss it with others, and I try to share my findings and knowledge as widely as I can. On these pages, you'll find details on a few of the literary projects I'm working on right now.

Why open up my work-in-progress to the public? Mostly because I want to demystify the processes of creating scholarly work and, more importantly, applying scholarly concepts, methods of analysis, and habits of mind to the literature that most deeply engages me. When I come face-to-face with students, I notice that they tend to be a bit baffled by the processes behind the things I do. They're baffled because all they really get to see are the smooth surfaces of things: slick presentations and clear, published prose, only my most polished work. They see the finished products as things without sources of origin, produced without risk of error or misdirection, and so they can't develop a meaningful sense of how a scholarly output inches its way fitfully into existence. I want to change that situation.
